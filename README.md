# DGIST-reading-room

The code for the reservation system for reading room on DGIST dormitory 1st floor.
Can use without internet connection, and recommand chrome for browse.
Chrome did not support cookies on localhost, so it use localStorage instead of cookies.
To clean off localStorage, we recommand typing initialize code(태연하트나연2) after use.
The default font in this file is '나눔스퀘어'. If you do not have it, change it to another.
